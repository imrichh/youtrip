Want to save the 2 hours you spend clicking on suggested videos while being devoured by the almighty [YouTube Spiral](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=YouTube%20Spiral)? 

**Enter the timemachine** - 
(1) Give it a youtube video, (2) number of videos you want to teleport yourself into the future and see where youtube algo takes you.

Do you fancy some good old [Pepa the Pig Season 2 Episode 43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgmmoGYT5IQ), 36 UNBELIEVABLE COOKING HACKS with 50m views or rather some 1 hour 15 minutes long [Vehicle Formation & Uses for Toddlers Season 1 Episode 367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3c0EgERsjw) with 3m views and 50/50 like/dislike ratio? Or maybe just a casual [Polish ‘Looking for a partner’ reality show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS3gsxAkBDk) where one of them believes a fillet is a type of fish from Indian Ocean. 

Sit back, buckle up and see how far the rabbit hole goes. Watch the terminal output or check back on the log file of your journey. Yaay.
