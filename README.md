Want to save the 2 hours you spend clicking on suggested videos while being devoured by the almighty [YouTube Spiral](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=YouTube%20Spiral)? 

**Enter the timemachine** - 
(1) Give it a youtube video, (2) number of videos you want to teleport yourself into the future and see where youtube algo takes you.

![If you see this, the gif did not load.](youtrip-demo.gif?raw=true )

Do you fancy some good old [Pepa the Pig Season 2 Episode 43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgmmoGYT5IQ), [Why are the Boeing 737NG engines Flat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKtvAWxjF4k) or rather some 1 hour 15 minutes long [Vehicle Formation & Uses for Toddlers Season 1 Episode 367](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3c0EgERsjw) with 3m views and 50/50 like/dislike ratio? Or maybe just a casual [Polish ‘Looking for a partner’ reality show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS3gsxAkBDk) where one of them believes a fillet is a type of fish from Indian Ocean. 

Sit back, buckle up and see how far the rabbit hole goes. *Watch the terminal output or check back on the csv file of your journey.* Yaay.
